##### Stock Kar Flutter Application
Stock Kar is a mobile application built using Flutter Framework. It helps the user to create a watchlist where the user can add their stocks to keep eye on them. This app also provides insight to the user among its added stock such as Top Losers, Top Gainers, 3 consecutive days looser, and 5 consecutive days looser. It also helps to manually add support level prices for the added stock and show alerts when the given stock price goes below the support level.
